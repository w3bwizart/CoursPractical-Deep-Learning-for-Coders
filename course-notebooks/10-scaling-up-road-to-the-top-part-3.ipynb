When we fine tune in this function I also have it calculate and return the TTA predictions on the test set, since later on we'll be ensembling the TTA results of a number of models. Note also that we no longer have `seed=42` in the `ImageDataLoaders` line -- that means we'll have different training and validation sets each time we call this. That's what we'll want for ensembling, since it means that each model will use slightly different data.\n",

    "*Gradient accumulation* refers to a very simple trick: rather than updating the model weights after every batch based on that batch's gradients, instead keep *accumulating* (adding up) the gradients for a few batches, and them update the model weights with those accumulated gradients. In fastai, the parameter you pass to `GradientAccumulation` defines how many batches of gradients are accumulated. Since we're adding up the gradients over `accum` batches, we therefore need to divide the batch size by that same number. The resulting training loop is nearly mathematically identical to using the original batch size, but the amount of memory used is the same as using a batch size `accum` times smaller!\n",

    "The key takeaway I hope to get across from this series so far is that you can get great results in image recognition using very little code and a very standardised approach, and that with a rigorous process you can improve in significant steps. Our training function, including data processing and TTA, is just half a dozen lines of code, plus another 7 lines of code to ensemble the models and create a submission file!\n",
